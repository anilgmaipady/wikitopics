The directory for downloading the archived wikistats.

Script
======

To get the files in the uppermost directory:
    nohup wget -r -w 5 -l 1 --no-parent -nH -o wikistats.log http://dammit.lt/wikistats/ &

To get files in the archive:
    nohup wget -r -w 5 -l 1 -nH --cut-dirs=1 --no-parent -o archive.log http://dammit.lt/wikistats/archive/2011/01/ &

Cautions
========
Some files in /wikistats/ were wrong.
The projectcounts files from 20110123-020000 to 20110124-010000 were all wrong. I had to manually remove them.
